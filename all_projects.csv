https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/designers-and-decorators/,Designer & Decorator Cost Guides,,,,,"The following cost factors should be considered when hiring a decorator for a designer:
Some interior designers and decorators work for themselves which can often mean they are more affordable. Larger firms generally charge more and this is because they have increased overhead. Firms sometimes have a design room where you can go in to see swatches and examples of work. These showrooms cost money which translates into higher costs for you.
The benefit of working with a firm, however, is that there are more employees who can help you. A design firm can often complete the work faster and ensure that there is always someone for you to talk to if you have questions or concerns.
The number of rooms you wish to have decorated will impact the total cost as well. Most designers and decorators work on an hourly basis. However, if you are looking to have your entire home redesigned, they may be willing to work with you and provide a more reasonable customized rate.
The style you want is going to play a role in price, too. Vintage designs may involve higher quality materials or hard to find décor. It is advantageous to talk to a professional to find out what styles they specialize in as they are likely going to know how to control costs so that you can get what you want while remaining in budget.
You may want to take advantage of a free consultation, or a low cost one. This will allow you to talk with the designer or decorator, get an idea of what they are capable of, and then make the decision to get started.
You need to ask an interior designer a variety of questions. This will make it easy for you to determine whether they are the right person to work with for your needs and wants.
These questions will tell you a lot about a designer and what they are able to do inside your home. By viewing their portfolio, you can see what they have been able to accomplish in the past – and whether this matches your vision. You can also learn about their fees and how they plan on managing a project budget.
Your designer should ask you questions as well. This will help them to understand more about what you want. If they don’t ask you questions, you should be concerned about whether they are capable of capturing your personality and delivering a look that you will love.
Some questions include:
Your designer may even ask you to go through various catalogs or magazine in order to show what you do and do not like. A common assignment is to make two piles – one full of photos you love and the other full of photos you hate. This should be a very basic response, so you don't want to overthink it. The designer will then be able to take the two piles and get an idea for the kinds of styles and trends you lean towards – and which ones to stay away from.
There are other reasons you may want to hire a designer or decorator. For example, if you are looking to sell a home, staging it can be a worthwhile investment. It will make your house look more like a home, and show people what the possibilities are from room to room. This can include rearranging furniture, choosing the right size furniture for every room, and helping you to clear away clutter.
You want your home to look its very best, and an interior decorator or designer may make recommendations on other aspects of your home that should be improved. This may include updating the color painted on the walls, cleaning glass shower doors, and even replacing such things as fireplace screens or dated kitchen cabinets. Talk to a professional to find out their level of expertise and how extensively they plan on helping you to update the rooms inside your home.
Every decorator and designer is a little different in terms of their experience and where their passion lies. You may want to talk with a few in order to determine how much they can help with. If you are looking for landscape design as well as interior design, this should be a consideration as well. Ultimately, your goal is to find a professional that meshes well with your own personal style."

Opting to purchase the bulk of your furnishings with one supplier could work out cheaper than buying from multiple outlets.

Buying from many retailers may make it more challenging to keep a handle on your budget, and you might incur additional delivery charges.

Appliances and utensils aren’t part of this cost guide, but some experts would also wrap them up under this term. The definition of furnishings often relates to anything not permanently attached to your house (i.e. cabinets, fireplaces, or built-in wardrobes).

This is especially important to consider for new builds and whole-home renovations. You can save a fair amount if you invest in multiple windows at the same time. Here’s what you can expect to pay for window installation depending on the number of windows.
Beyond size, type, and brand, a few other factors influence the cost of installing windows.
Custom-designed windows cost more than ready-made ones. You might need a custom-shaped bay window or an extra tall window for a room with high ceilings. Any window that deviates from standard design costs more, which you should consider when making your budget.
An important cost factor with window installation is whether you’re installing an entirely new window or simply replacing an old one. For replacement, you’ll need to pay to buy and install the new window (assuming it fits the space), which costs between
.
However, installing a window where there wasn’t one before—as either part of a new construction project or a major renovation—incurs more costs. New window installation requires framing, siding, finishing work, and possibly rerouting plumbing or electrical lines. These factors can drive the price of a new construction window as high as

You'll also want to consider what
you want based on your home's style and energy-efficiency goals.
If there's no existing wiring, installing a ceiling fan becomes a more extensive project. A pro will need to open up walls, run wires, install boxes, and handle the final connections at the junction box. This kind of installation can cost up to $2,000.
Installing a ceiling fan with existing wiring costs $100 to $300 on average for a basic install, though some units run around $1,400 for designer-level comfort and style. To do this, a pro installs the unit on an existing light box. Then, they place a brace in the ceiling if the box isn't rated to hold the weight of the entire unit. While less expensive, you won't have your light and fan on separate switches. To get switch power, you'll need to run another line and add a larger box and switch.
Another option is to purchase a fan with a remote control to operate the light and fan separately without installing additional wiring. Most range between $150 and $300 without installation.
Thinking of installing more than one ceiling fan? You might spend between $200 and $600 for two fans, though high-end models can push costs up to $4,000. Installing multiple fans at once can save you money on labor and materials.

Replacing a ceiling fan costs between $100 and $275 if you do it yourself. Hiring a handyperson can cost as low as $60. You won't need any wiring or supports since it'll be a simple pull and replace. It’s a great time to upgrade the wiring and reinforce the supports behind it, but not usually necessary.
$80 to $200 on average. You might save a little by repairing what you have rather than replacing it. Often, this process involves putting new parts in but saving the overall unit.
Ceiling fans cost $250 on average to install, including the unit, which is 4% of the cost of installing a central AC system. In addition, a ceiling fan is far less costly to run.
Even if you put six ceiling fans in at a total of $1,500 to $2,000, that's about 25% of the price of putting in an air conditioner. Compare this to the cost of installing central air or a ductless AC system:
Ceiling fans offer several advantages:
Unless you're experienced with electrical work, installing a ceiling fan yourself can be risky. Wobbly or drooping fans are often the result of improper installation. A professional will ensure the ceiling fan is wired correctly, supported properly, and leveled to reduce vibrations. To avoid potential hazards, consider hiring a ceiling fan installer, handyperson, or electrician.
